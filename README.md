# How to Backup Your Windows Activation
Backing up your Windows license helps in case of reinstall. Here's how:
1. Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
2. Type:
```
slmgr /dlv
```
Save the **Activation ID** and **Installation ID**.
3. Use a third-party tool like **Advanced Tokens Manager** for full backup.
> **Tip:** Backup works best if restoring on the same hardware with the same Windows version.
